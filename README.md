# [K1] Taris Sith Uniform Disguise Extension
Changes the requirement to access the Lower City elevator to all party members wearing a Sith Soldier disguise rather than just one. Adds extra disguises to the party and interrogation scenes in the Upper City North Apartments. 

Requires a save before entering the Apartments for the first time.
